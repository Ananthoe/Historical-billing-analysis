## 🧠 Project Summary

This was my **first real-world analytics project**, conducted for **Flextrus Corrugated Packaging Boxes India (P) Ltd**, a carton manufacturing business run by my family. It taught me how to extract real insights from messy operational data using just **Excel** and **SQL**. I created pivot tables, explored trends across segments, and developed a full analysis report — entirely without Power BI or automation tools.

> 📌 Tools Used: **Excel (Pivot Tables & Charts)**, **SQL (Qureying)**

## 📋 Business Questions Addressed

1. What is the total revenue generated by each segment?  
2. How does revenue trend monthly and quarterly?  
3. What’s the customer distribution across segments?  
4. What is the average invoice value by segment?  
5. Which customers contribute the most revenue?  
6. Which segments show repeat vs. single-purchase behavior?  
7. What are the top-performing months per segment?

## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean and join raw invoice and customer data in Excel  
- Use **pivot tables** to perform aggregations, sorting, filtering  
- Analyze repeat purchases, customer distribution, and revenue cycles  
- Document findings in a structured business report

## 🔍 Key Highlights

### 📈 Revenue Concentration
- **Food-Cashew** segment alone contributed ₹3.1 crore in 2 years  
- This poses a business risk due to overdependence on a single segment

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Customer Volume
- **Misc segment:** 22 customers  
- **Food segment:** 12 customers  
- Other segments: mostly 1–4 customers

### 🔁 Purchase Behavior
- **Food & Food-Cashew:** Strong repeat purchase trend  
- **Misc:** Primarily one-time buyers — potential for retention push

### 📅 Revenue Trends
- Best month: **July 2023** (₹40.9 lakhs)  
- Quarterly peak: **Q4 of Year 1** (₹1 crore)  
- Year 2 shows consistent growth

### 🥇 Top Customers = Top Revenue
- In Food, Electronics, and Food-Sea, **top 20% customers contributed 80%+ revenue**

---

## Recommendations

- 🧠 **Segment Risk:** ₹3.1 crore from Food-Cashew alone exposes the business to high dependency risk  
- 👥 **Customer Base:** Most segments need customer acquisition push, except Misc and Food  
- 📈 **Revenue Concentration:** Relying on a few high-value customers increases volatility  
- 📊 **Growth Areas:** Year 2 shows promising trends — Electronics is an emerging stronghold  

> 🔄 **Recommendation:** Diversify across segments and reduce over-reliance on top customers
